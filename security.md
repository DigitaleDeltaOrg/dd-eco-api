# Security

The DD-ECO-API can be protected using the following methods:

- Using API keys, by using the X-API-KEY header
- Using OAUTH2
- No protection

Which method to use is up to the provider. It can be specified per endpoint.
It is, however, recommended that the /endpoints endpoint is left unprotected.
